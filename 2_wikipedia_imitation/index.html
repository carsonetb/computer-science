            <b>The Roman Forum is a rectangular forum</b> (plaza) surrounded by the ruins 
            of several important ancient government buildings at the centre of the city of Rome. 
            Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the 
            <b><i>Forum Magnum,</i></b> or simply the Forum.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was for centuries the centre of Roman public life: the site of triumphal processions and 
            elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and 
            gladiatorial matches; and 
            the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great
            men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place 
            in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and 
            Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and 
            intermittent archeological excavations attracting numerous sightseers.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Roman Kingdom</h3>
        <p>
            The original, low-lying, grassy wetland of the Forum was drained in the 7th century BC with 
            the building of the <i>Cloaca Maxima</i>, a large covered sewer system that emptied into the Tiber 
            River, as more people began to settle between the two hills.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to tradition, the Forum's beginnings are connected with the alliance between Romulus, 
            the first king of Rome controlling the Palatine Hill, and his rival, Titus Tatius, who occupied 
            the Capitoline Hill. An alliance formed after combat had been halted by the prayers and cries 
            of the Sabine women. Because the valley lay between the two settlements, it was the designated 
            place for the two peoples to meet. Since the early Forum area included pools of stagnant water, 
            the most easily accessible area was the northern part of the valley which was designated as the 
            Comitium. It was here at the Vulcanal that, according to the story, the two parties laid down 
            their weapons and formed an alliance.
        </p>
        <h3>Roman Republic</h3>
        <p>
            During the Republican period the Comitium continued to be the central location for all judicial 
            and political life in the city. However, in order to create a larger gathering place, the Senate 
            began expanding the open area between the Comitium and the Temple of Vesta by purchasing existing 
            private homes and removing them for public use. Building projects of several consuls repaved and 
            built onto both the Comitium and the adjacent central plaza that was becoming the Forum.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 5th century BC witnessed the construction of the earliest Forum temples with known dates of 
            construction: the Temple of Saturn (497 BC) and the Temple of Castor and Pollux (484 BC). The 
            Temple of Concord was added in the following century, possibly by the soldier and statesman Marcus 
            Furius Camillus. A long held tradition of speaking from the elevated speakers' Rostra - originally 
            facing north towards the Senate House to the politicians and assembled elite - put the orator's 
            back to the people assembled in the Forum. A tribune known as Caius Licinius (consul in 361 BC) 
            was supposed to have been the first to turn away from the Roman elite towards the people in the 
            Forum, an act symbolically repeated two centuries later by Gaius Gracchus.
        </p>
        <h3>Roman Empire</h3>
        <p>
            After Julius Caesar's death, and the end of the subsequent Civil Wars, Augustus would finish his 
            great-uncle's work, giving the Forum its final form. This included the southeastern end of the 
            plaza where he constructed the Temple of Divus Iulius and the Arch of Augustus there (both in 
            29 BC). <b>The Forum was witness to the assassination of a Roman Emperor in 69 AD</b>: 
            Galba had set 
            out from the palace to meet rebels, but was so feeble that he had to be carried in a litter. He 
            was immediately met by a troop of his rival Otho's cavalry near the Lacus Curtius in the Forum, 
            where he was killed.
        </p>
        <p>
            During these early Imperial times much economic and judicial business transferred away from 
            the Forum to larger and more extravagant structures to the north. After the building of Trajan's 
            Forum (110 AD), these activities transferred to the Basilica Ulpia.
