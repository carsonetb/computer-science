            <h1>Wikipedia</h1>
            <p class="page_description">
                Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is community maintained.
                You probably know what it is, and according to the great 
                teacher of all things on the interwebz, it apparently used
                to look like this:
                <br>
                <img class="roman-forum" src="image.png">
                It is important to note that the teacher was a Linux (probably
                Ubuntu) user. Dully note that Ubuntu today is considered a 
                relic of simpler times, when worries were few, compared to 
                today's more advanced systems of operation. Indeed, before 
                we continue it is also important to note that the teacher was
                a Firefox user. This was before the great downfall of Mozilla
                and the scattering of forks.

                <br>
                Anyway, at this stage of your humble journey, it would most 
                likely be impossible for you to recreate this image correctly.
                It's time to learn a new tool.

            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p class="page_description">
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the last of the 
                three pillars of the web. Essentially, it makes the website
                act a certain way, it <i>customizes</i> the tags. Usually, 
                you will write CSS in a seperate file, hidden away from the 
                HTML and abstracted into a link, but sometimes, in special 
                cases or simply because the user is archaic, you will find 
                CSS in the lines of HTML. Hence the name inline.
                <br>
                <br>
                Below is a simple program. Type in both the boxes to update
                the HTML (tags) and the CSS (styles).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor_container" id="code_editor">
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="textbox", rows="5" cols="70">&lt;p&gt;Some Text&lt;/p&gt;</textarea>
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="cssbox", rows="5" cols="70">p { font-family: arial; color: red; }</textarea>
            <div id="htmlhere"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p class="page_description">
                If you delete the strange text from the middle box, you will
                see that the generated HTML's font changes from a sans serif 
                font (arial) that is colored red, to a black seriffed font
                (most likely 
                <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Times New Roman</span>).
                <br>
                <br>
                As you can see, the CSS is styling the HTML. You can sort of 
                gather how the syntax works:
                <ul>
                    <li>Each tag can have styles. In this case it is p, so 
                        you would start by typing the p tag and then an open
                        curly brace ({)
                    </li>
                    <li>There are a very large amount of attributes a tag can
                        have. In this case we used the font-family attribute 
                        and the color attribute. When using attributes, you 
                        should frame them like this: attribute: value; making 
                        sure to have the semicolon at the end.
                    </li>
                    <li>End each tag with a closing curly bracket (})</li>
                </ul>
                CSS also has the concept of classes. Here is what they look
                like in action:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor_container" id="code_editor">
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="textbox", rows="5" cols="70">&lt;p class="text"&gt;Some Text&lt;/p&gt;</textarea>
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="cssbox", rows="5" cols="70">.text { font-family: arial; color: red; }</textarea>
            <div id="htmlhere"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p class="page_description">
                As you can see, instead of the p tag we are using the .text 
                class in CSS. This comes in handy when you want to have 
                different styles for different tags. 
            </p>
            <h1>Float</h1>
            <p class="page_description">Here is an image:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor_container" id="code_editor">
            <textarea custom_css=" " class="code_editor" id="textbox", rows="5" cols="70">&lt;img src="cookie.png" width=50%&gt;</textarea>
            <div id="htmlhere"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p class="page_description">And here is an image on the right:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor_container" id="code_editor">
            <textarea lass="code_editor" id="textbox", rows="5" cols="70">
&lt;img src="cookie.png" width=50%&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here is some text also
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    that goes down far
&lt;/p&gt;</textarea>
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="cssbox", rows="5" cols="70">
img {
    float: right;
}</textarea>
            <div id="htmlhere"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p class="page_description">
                Note that the text element has to go after 
                the image for them to be side by side. You
                can also choose to put another div/img and 
                float it to the left to make two objects 
                that are adjacent.

                Now supposedly you should have all the skills
                neccesary to develop a website that looks 
                somewhat similar to the one shown earlier.
