            <p class="page_description">
                Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is community maintained.
                You probably know what it is, and according to the great 
                teacher of all things on the interwebz, it apparently used
                to look like this:
                <br>
                <img class="roman-forum" src="image.png">
                It is important to note that the teacher was a Linux (probably
                Ubuntu) user. Dully note that Ubuntu today is considered a 
                relic of simpler times, when worries were few, compared to 
                today's more advanced systems of operation. Indeed, before 
                we continue it is also important to note that the teacher was
                a Firefox user.

                Anyway, at this stage of your humble journey, it would most 
                likely be impossible for you to recreate this image correctly.
                It's time to learn a new tool.
            </p>
            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p class="page_description">
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the last of the 
                three pillars of the web. Essentially, it makes the website
                act a certain way, it <i>customizes</i> the tags. Usually, 
                you will write CSS in a seperate file, hidden away from the 
                HTML and abstracted into a link, but sometimes, in special 
                cases or simply because the user is archaic, you will find 
                CSS in the lines of HTML. Hence the name inline.
                <br>
                <br>
                Below is a simple program. Type in both the boxes to update
                the HTML (tags) and the CSS (styles).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor_container" id="code_editor">
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="textbox", rows="5" cols="70">&lt;p&gt;Some Text&lt;/p&gt;</textarea>
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="cssbox", rows="5" cols="70">p { font-family: arial; color: red; }</textarea>
            <div id="htmlhere"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p class="page_description">
                If you delete the strange text from the middle box, you will
                see that the generated HTML's font changes from a sans serif 
                font (arial) that is colored red, to a black seriffed font
                (most likely 
                <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Times New Roman</span>).
                <br>
                <br>
                As you can see, the CSS is styling the HTML. You can sort of 
                gather how the syntax works:
                <ul>
                    <li>Each tag can have styles. In this case it is p, so 
                        you would start by typing the p tag and then an open
                        curly brace ({)
                    </li>
                    <li>There are a very large amount of attributes a tag can
                        have. In this case we used the font-family attribute 
                        and the color attribute. When using attributes, you 
                        should frame them like this: attribute: value; making 
                        sure to have the semicolon at the end.
                    </li>
                    <li>End each tag with a closing curly bracket (})</li>
                </ul>
                CSS also has the concept of classes. Here is what they look
                like in action:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor_container" id="code_editor">
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="textbox", rows="5" cols="70">&lt;p class="text"&gt;Some Text&lt;/p&gt;</textarea>
            <textarea class="code_editor" id="cssbox", rows="5" cols="70">.text { font-family: arial; color: red; }</textarea>
            <div id="htmlhere"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p class="page_description">
                As you can see, instead of the p tag we are using the .text 
                class in CSS. This comes in handy when you want to have 
                different styles for different tags. 
            </p>
            <h1>Float</h1>
            <p class="page_description">Here is an image:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor_container" id="code_editor">
            <textarea custom_css=" " class="code_editor" id="textbox", rows="5" cols="70">&lt;img src="cookie.png" width=50%&gt;</textarea>

    &lt;br&gt;

        <div class="contents">
            <p class="page_description">
                Note that the text element has to go after 
                the image for them to be side by side. You
                can also choose to put another div/img and 
                float it to the left to make two objects 
                that are adjacent.
                <br>

                Now supposedly you should have all the skills
                neccesary to develop a website that looks 
                somewhat similar to the one shown earlier. 
                Here is all the text on the website, so you
                don't have to type it out all by yourself,
                and then there is a HTML and CSS editor along
                with the image. Try to get your final website 
                to look as similar to the image as possible.
                When programming the image, you can use the 
                path "forum.jpg"

                <b>The Roman Forum is a rectangular forum</b> (plaza) surrounded by the ruins 
                of several important ancient government buildings at the centre of the city of Rome. 
                Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the 
                <b><i>Forum Magnum,</i></b> or simply the Forum.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was for centuries the centre of Roman public life: the site of triumphal processions and 
                elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and 
                gladiatorial matches; and 
                the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great
                men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place 
                in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and 
                Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and 
                intermittent archeological excavations attracting numerous sightseers.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Roman Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
                The original, low-lying, grassy wetland of the Forum was drained in the 7th century BC with 
                the building of the <i>Cloaca Maxima</i>, a large covered sewer system that emptied into the Tiber 
                River, as more people began to settle between the two hills.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to tradition, the Forum's beginnings are connected with the alliance between Romulus, 
                the first king of Rome controlling the Palatine Hill, and his rival, Titus Tatius, who occupied 
                the Capitoline Hill. An alliance formed after combat had been halted by the prayers and cries 
                of the Sabine women. Because the valley lay between the two settlements, it was the designated 
                place for the two peoples to meet. Since the early Forum area included pools of stagnant water, 
                the most easily accessible area was the northern part of the valley which was designated as the 
                Comitium. It was here at the Vulcanal that, according to the story, the two parties laid down 
                their weapons and formed an alliance.
            </p>
            <h3>Roman Republic</h3>
            <p>
                During the Republican period the Comitium continued to be the central location for all judicial 
                and political life in the city. However, in order to create a larger gathering place, the Senate 
                began expanding the open area between the Comitium and the Temple of Vesta by purchasing existing 
                private homes and removing them for public use. Building projects of several consuls repaved and 
                built onto both the Comitium and the adjacent central plaza that was becoming the Forum.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 5th century BC witnessed the construction of the earliest Forum temples with known dates of 
                construction: the Temple of Saturn (497 BC) and the Temple of Castor and Pollux (484 BC). The 
                Temple of Concord was added in the following century, possibly by the soldier and statesman Marcus 
                Furius Camillus. A long held tradition of speaking from the elevated speakers' Rostra - originally 
                facing north towards the Senate House to the politicians and assembled elite - put the orator's 
                back to the people assembled in the Forum. A tribune known as Caius Licinius (consul in 361 BC) 
                was supposed to have been the first to turn away from the Roman elite towards the people in the 
                Forum, an act symbolically repeated two centuries later by Gaius Gracchus.
            </p>
            <h3>Roman Empire</h3>
            <p>
                After Julius Caesar's death, and the end of the subsequent Civil Wars, Augustus would finish his 
                great-uncle's work, giving the Forum its final form. This included the southeastern end of the 
                plaza where he constructed the Temple of Divus Iulius and the Arch of Augustus there (both in 
                29 BC). <b>The Forum was witness to the assassination of a Roman Emperor in 69 AD</b>: 
                Galba had set 
                out from the palace to meet rebels, but was so feeble that he had to be carried in a litter. He 
                was immediately met by a troop of his rival Otho's cavalry near the Lacus Curtius in the Forum, 
                where he was killed.
            </p>
            <p>
                During these early Imperial times much economic and judicial business transferred away from 
                the Forum to larger and more extravagant structures to the north. After the building of Trajan's 
                Forum (110 AD), these activities transferred to the Basilica Ulpia.
